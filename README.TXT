Project: Ocean Predator Pray Simulation
Authors: Jakub Grzelak and Daniel Koch

A predator-prey simulation involving sharks, orcas, salmons, sardines, scubadivers and seaweed in
an enclosed rectangular field.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 4000 steps.
